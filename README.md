# Weather Dashboard

Description: Using the search filed at the top, enter a city name to display current weather information such as, low, high, & current temps, wind speed, weather conditions and humidity. Below the current weather information you will find the 5 day forecast information allowing you to plan your week accordingly around the weather.

In this project there were 3 different API's used to obtain this information, one for each section of the webpage. The 3 API's used are one for the UV-Index, current weather information, and lastly the 5 day forecast. API's are in 3rd party available to the public allowing web developers to create such platforms/projects with a url address specific to that topic.

The languages and technologies used in this project are HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, JavaScript, OpenWeather API's, & Moment.js.
